Virtual Mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI
This project demonstrates a virtual mouse using hand gesture recognition. By leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, the application can detect hand movements via a webcam and simulate mouse actions such as moving the cursor and clicking.

Features
Real-time Hand Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe's hand detection capabilities to track hand landmarks in real-time.
Cursor Control: Maps the position of the index finger to control the cursor movement on the screen.
Click Simulation: Detects when the thumb and index finger come close together to simulate a mouse click.
Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyAutoGUI
